# cim_portfolio

A portfolio analysis program written in Clojure.

## Installation

Please ensure Java, Clojure, Leiningen are installed prior to running this application.

KEY DEPENDENCY: clj-python/libpython-clj
libpython-clj (https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj) is a key requirement to run Python code within Clojure.
Python objects are linked to JVM, allowing Clojure to run the server.clj file that enables scraping data from Python's yfinance package.

Please install Python on your system and ensure yfinance is installed.
Please run: `pip install yfinance` 

## Usage

- Clone the github repository to your local computer.
- Open the cloned folder in your terminal and run `lein gorilla`
- Open the URL provided in the terminal in your browser of choice
- Hit **Ctrl G + Ctrl L** and load `src/cim_portfolio/server.clj`
- Run all the code blocks with **Shift + Enter** or **Ctrl + Enter**
- If the output shows proper finance data, load `src/cim_portfolio/portfolio.clj`. If error, flag the issue and try to debug.
- Run all code blocks in portfolio.clj except for the last one.
- Enter the relative path to your csv file containing all your trades (relative to main directory)
